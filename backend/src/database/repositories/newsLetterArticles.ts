      New York City has launched "Ur in Luck," a new initiative led by Mayor Eric Adams to improve public restroom accessibility across the city. This program aims to construct 46 new public restrooms and renovate 36 existing ones over the next five years, with renovations including accessibility upgrades and additional stalls. Additionally, a new Google Maps layer has been added to help residents and visitors locate these facilities easily. This plan is in response to the city's recognition of the urgent need for more public restrooms to ensure equity and improve the quality of life.
