Despite the financial hardships that led to the bankruptcy of its original owners, the Essex House has become a prominent figure in New York City's skyline, thanks in part to its iconic red neon sign added a year after opening.The building was designed by the architectural firm Walker & Gillette, and it showcases an Art Deco architectural style, characteristic of many prominent structures built in New York City during the late 1920s and early 1930s.'
