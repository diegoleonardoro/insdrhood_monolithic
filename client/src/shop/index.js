    description: " TEXT: The New Yorker Hotel, located at 481 Eighth Avenue in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, was designed by architecture firm Sugarman and Berger and opened its doors on January 2, 1930. It's recognized for its Art Deco architectural style, which was prevalent in New York during the 1920s and 1930s, similar to its contemporaries like the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The hotel's facade features alternating vertical bands of warm gray brick and windows, creating an impression of boldly modeled masses, further emphasized by dramatic lighting at night and deep-cut light courts. The Hotel is known for its iconic neon sign.This sign, located on the western facade of the hotel, spells out 'New Yorker' in 21 - foot - high(6.4 m) capital letters.The original sign, which illuminated the skyline from 1941 to 1967, was a prominent feature of the New York City skyline.However, it remained dark for several decades until 2005, when it was replaced with a new LED sign.
